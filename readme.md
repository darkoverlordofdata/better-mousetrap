Building a better mousetrap

A more functional style comparng c++ and vala.


## status

performance-wise it's a dead heat between vala and c++.

vala, especially genie, is so much easier and faster to code and understand what I've coded, and the gnome libs are great. 

Problem is, gnome xplatform support has big gaps. I can't get glib to compile for enscriptem or android. my gjs projects don't run on windows.

Now I see why. Because they aren't doing anything about it.

the real question is not 'Is vala a good choice' but 'Why use gnome?'

#### resources.c / resources.cc is missing
it's 4mb and doesn't fit on git hub. use the resources.c generated by shmupwarz
