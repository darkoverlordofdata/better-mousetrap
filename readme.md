Building a better mousetrap

@see http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/data-locality.html

A more functional style comparng c++ and vala.


## status

performance-wise it's a dead heat between vala and c++.

vala, especially genie, is so much easier and faster to code and understand what I've coded, and the gnome libs are great. 

Problem is, gnome xplatform support has big gaps. I can't get glib to compile for enscriptem or android.

## a new hope
https://github.com/radare/posixvala

It works - I can compile vala/genie to wasm. 
Works with classic (stable) SDL. SDL2 get's a syntax error.

no data structs (list, dict, array are from libGee), only GList, struct and [].
however, libGee is implemented in Vala, so all I need to do is create an ersatz version and plugin it in. 

#### resources.c / resources.cc is missing
it's 4mb and doesn't fit on git hub. use the resources.c generated by shmupwarz
