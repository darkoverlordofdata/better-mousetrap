Building a better mousetrap

@see http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/data-locality.html

A more functional style comparng c++ and vala.


## status

performance-wise it's a dead heat between vala and c++.

vala, especially genie, is so much easier and faster to code and understand what I've coded, and the gnome libs are great. 

Problem is, gnome xplatform support has big gaps. I can't get glib to compile for enscriptem or android.

## a new hope
https://github.com/radare/posixvala

I can now compile vala/genie to wasm. I can create entitas and sdx as posix compatible libs.

    posixvalac --vapidir ./vapis --pkg sdl --pkg emscripten -C --save-temps --disable-warnings hello_world.gs
    emcc `pkg-config posixvala --cflags` -s WASM=1 -s USE_SDL=1 hello_world.c -o index.html


no data structs (list, dict, array are from libGee), only GList, struct and [].

#### resources.c / resources.cc is missing
it's 4mb and doesn't fit on git hub. use the resources.c generated by shmupwarz
