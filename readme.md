Building a better mousetrap

@see http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/data-locality.html

A more functional style using c++ and vala.

This vala version runs about 80% as fast as c++ version, and about 50x faster than the current version of entitas-vala

c++  0.000057
vala 0.000069

About 80% as fast as c++, with less variance.

difference is likely overhead for data structures, stdlib vs GLib, plus Vala generated oop boilerplate.

## 
#### resources.c / resources.cc is missing
it's 4mb and doesn't fit on git hub. use the resources.c generated by shmupwarz
