Building a better mousetrap

@see http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/data-locality.html

A more functional style comparng c++ and vala.


## status

testing

template driven using entitas-cli

* no multi-cast events
* no component caching needed due to by-value design
* modified matcher to use bit array, similar to artemis. 

currently, a uint64 is used as a bit array, so there are up to 63 components. 
this should be plenty, and can be incresed if needed.

#### resources.c / resources.cc is missing
it's 4mb and doesn't fit on git hub. use the resources.c generated by shmupwarz
